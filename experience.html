          <p>
            Navigating the experience of being an entrepreneur I learned the
            importance of decision making. If I could prove a decision with data
            much better. By working in the travel industry, I was exposed to the
            volatility of the dollar and was hooked by the idea of ​​becoming a
            trader, and an investor. I knew the importance of decision making
            based on data from my previous work experience at maistrip.com, and
            that is exactly what an investor have to do. In the past five years
            I collected as much data as I could and arrived at an investment
            thesis contextualized by the economic environment in which the world
            was. I had friends that I partnered with and participated in several
            discussions about these thesis. Financial and economic dashboards,
            business management and evolution of KPIs, balance sheets of central
            banks and companies, interest rates, forecasting of inflation,
            currencies analysis, correlation of assets for portfolio management,
            regressions, data analysis day in and day out.

            Maistrip.com was a dream come true. I always had the idea of&nbsp;
            ​​building something from scratch, having the chance to put myself
            in an unpredictable environment. I see life as an opportunity to
            accumulate experience, at that time anything was more challenging
            than building a business myself. I had the great opportunity to
            develop a partnership with a friend of mine. His family had many
            years of experience in the retail tourism business, and I truly
            believe it was a smart move of mine to partner with them; having
            their experience with me, instead of going into the "jungle" alone.
            Branding, the positioning of our products, market analysis, field
            research against competitors, marketing campaigns, the financial
            management of a small company, the relationship with customers and
            suppliers, the experience of building our website from scratch
            managing developers, the analysis of data on a daily basis to
            understand the evolution of the business itself, it was all very
            exciting and very entrepreneurial. I see that experience as valuable
            as an MBA.

            At Morgan Stanley, I was privileged to work with a high level team.
            I was exposed to the North American work ethic, where I learned a
            lot. I had the opportunity to build a great relationship with the
            people I worked with, although the environment was quite
            challenging. The pace of work and the pressure to pay attention to
            details, especially since each transaction had a high notional
            value, made the experience incredible. I used to work with two other
            Stock Loan dealers, where I supported them and, at the same time,
            got involved with third parties to make sure everything was going
            the way it should. Prepare reports, manage stock portfolio, manage
            customer expectations by email, phone calls and face-to-face
            meetings, I used to receive over 60 calls a day. All of this in a
            super stressful environment where people sometimes were losing
            money. Being a calm and responsible person at that time was a
            fundamental behavior and that often made all the difference.

            day I could get approved at a competitive process, that I would need
            to pass in a national exam. The exam includes a health test, a
            physical test and an intellectual test. As a cadet, you have a
            world-class educational system. From psychology, sociology, history,
            mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, strategy,
            command, military training, in my case mountain climbing and many
            different leadership experiences in the military field and outside
            the military field as well. The chance to manage others is a
            beautiful privilege. You end up learning more about yourself and you
            give back to them as well. If I had to define all my experience at
            that time, I would say the courage and the responsibility to set the
