          <h1>A career learning the science of decision making from data...</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Over 8 years of experience in international business and
            entrepreneurship. Skilled in exploratory data analysis, an expert in
            financial analytics, and well-qualified in business model strategy
            analysis. Passionate about discovering new insights from the
            convergence of multiple data sources to make smart, fast, and
            reliable business decisions.<br /><br />

            Bachelor’s in business administration in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I have
            also studied International Finance at Bentley University in
            Massachusetts. I am a Python, JavaScript, C, SQL and DAX developer.
            I have improved my knowledge in computer science; data structure,
            and algorithms at 42 Silicon Valley, Software Engineering School.
            Currently, I am studying Data Science & Business Analytics at the
            Post Graduate Program, from The University of Texas at Austin - Red
            McCombs School of Business.
            <br /><br />

            In the last 5 years, I have participated in national and
            international stock and futures market investments decisions. I have
            explored different companies through their fundamental’s analysis,
            created financial models, valuation analysis, capital budgeting to
            master the company’s business decisions, and value creation. I have
            also developed myself in quantitative macroeconomics which made me
            able to contextualize my investment approaches, exploring the data
            through inferential statistics, descriptive statistics, and more
            sophisticated methods of data analysis. <br /><br />

            I am a professional driven by challenges with a diverse background
            that has made me flexible, adaptable, and a fast thinker. My
            contributions created valuable experiences for those who have worked
            with me, building a positive legacy. I am a dedicated and curious
            person who appreciates different perspectives and constantly seeks
            the professional growth and development of my team always eager to
            reach one step further.<br />
